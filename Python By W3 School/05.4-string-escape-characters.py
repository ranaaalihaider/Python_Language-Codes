'''To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:'''

#a="Hi i am telling you season name that is "Vikings" you must watch it"
#print(a)
#This was wrong one you can not use"" inside string so we can use \ (backslash) for this
a="Hi i am telling you season name that is \"Vikings\" you must watch it"
print(a)
ab="Hi i am ali"
print(ab)
